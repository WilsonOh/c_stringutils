A library of string utility functions for C that I wrote for fun.
The implementation might not be very good as I'm still learning C.

Documentation for the functions are in the source `stringutils.c` file.<br>
It is the user's reponsibility to free the memory allocated for the string returned
from the functions

## TODO
